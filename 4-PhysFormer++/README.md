## Problem

The problem is the inconvenience of traditional physiological measurement methods requiring sensor attachments. Current remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) methods face challenges in handling complex scenarios, leading to performance drops. The proposed solution introduces transformer architectures (PhysFormer and PhysFormer++) to enhance rPPG measurement by considering long-range spatio-temporal features in facial videos.


## Importance

The importance lies in addressing the limitations of traditional physiological measurement methods, providing a non-intrusive and convenient approach through remote photoplethysmography (rPPG). The proposed transformer architectures (PhysFormer and PhysFormer++) offer a novel solution to improve the accuracy of physiological signal measurement, especially in healthcare and medical monitoring, by considering both local and global spatio-temporal features from facial videos. This innovation could lead to more accessible and effective remote health monitoring systems.

## Insights
