## Problem

Facial Expression Recognition (FER) faces challenges due to variations in expression patterns and uncertainties in the data. Existing methods tend to focus on a limited number of highly discriminative patterns, leading to false predictions when expressions share significant similarities in specific facial parts.
## Importance

Accurate FER has significant implications in various applications, including sociable robots, medical treatment, and human-computer interaction systems. Improving FER can enhance the performance of these systems, providing better emotional understanding and interaction capabilities.

The proposed Mid-level Representation Enhancement (MRE) addresses the issue of over-dominance by mixing mid-level representations with samples from other expressions. This injects partial features as noise, preventing the network from being overly confident in specific partial patterns. Additionally, the introduction of an expression classification module based on the variant mid-level representation enhances robustness.Graph Embedded Uncertainty Suppressing (GUS) tackles uncertainty by using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to establish semantic relations between representations. This helps in reducing covariate shifting and improving the overall reliability of the model.
