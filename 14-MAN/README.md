# Paper Summary

## Insights and Recommendations

| Point                                      | Description                                                                                      |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Multimodal Attention Network**           | Proposed network effectively integrates video and EEG for enhanced emotion recognition.         |
| **Performance Improvement**               | Demonstrated improved performance over single-modality networks on MAHNOB-HCI and ASIA datasets.|
| **Synergy Through Fusion**                | Achieved synergy by determining the most important modality through attention weights.           |
| **Continuous-Time Valence Labels**        | Addressed challenges in datasets with continuous-time valence labels relying on facial expressions. |
| **Future Annotation Methods**             | Suggested exploring annotation methods for continuous-time emotions without facial expression dependence. |
| **Bio-Signal Fusion Technology**          | Recommended investigating fusion technology with additional bio-signals for more effective recognition. |
| **Dataset Improvement**                   | Proposed building a new dataset with diverse emotions and improved annotation skills for better research. |

## Weaknesses

| Point                                      | Description                                                                                      |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reliability of EEG Modality**           | Reduced due to using the same valence label as GT for both video and EEG modalities.             |
| **Recognition of Negative Emotions**      | Inferior recognition for negative emotions with subtle facial changes.                             |
| **Limited Generalization for Asians**     | Concentrated labels on 'neutral' limit generalization for recognizing Asian emotions.            |

## Future Ideas

- Explore annotation methods for continuous-time emotions.
- Investigate fusion technology with additional bio-signals (e.g., EMG, GSR).
- Build a new dataset with diverse emotions and improved annotation skills.
